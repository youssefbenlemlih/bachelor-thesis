## Abstract
Nowadays mobile applications and websites are developed and used more than ever. One of the leading frameworks for the creation of user interfaces is React. Although React is the most used web framework in 2021, there is a disagreement on how to manage its application state. This thesis compares common approaches by investigating a selection of state management libraries. A software evaluation framework is used to analyze the quality of each library. Finally the results are compared and general conclusions are made about the suitability of each approach.
